# Crypto Clustering Challenge

This challenge utilizes unsupervised learning to help analyze cryptocurrency data using data clustering. After preparing the data using StandardScaler, I utilized K-Means to cluster data. I then used Priniciple Component Analysis to reduce dementionality and optimize clusters. Resulting visualizations are compared with K-Means to show the benefit of reducing dementionality in this dataset.
